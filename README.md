Java overlay program for League of Legends' Teamfight Tactics.

Only works in **windowed** or **borderless** fullscreen mode of LoL!

## Features

- Item overview
- Item builder
- Classes and origins overview and chart
- Patch data updater
- Information hilights

## Planed Features

- Team builder based on item recommendations
- Champion and Item search
- Automatic patch detection

## Known Issues

- Does not work when LoL is in fullscreen. Use **windowed** or **borderless** mode!
- Tooltips only show when the overlay is focused. That's a Java Swing issue to which I'll eventually add a workaround by using custom tooltips.

## Downloads

Either use the releases or the [latest development builds](https://ci.minebench.de/job/TFT-Overlay/) ([Direct download](https://ci.minebench.de/job/TFT-Overlay/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/target/TFT-Overlay.jar)).

The Overlay requires at least Java 8 to run.
